# Contributing

Help with the project is very welcome!

The most basic way to help is just using it, possibly starring the repo, and reporting any issues that you may find.
Going beyond that, actually fixing the issue with a code patch would be even more awesome, but not expected at all.

A good issue clearly details the expected behavior, the observed behavior, and aby possible context & steps to reproduce.
A good PR fixes the issue, without touching unrelated code, whilst also following all of our coding practices, like for example code formatting.
