## Reporting a Vulnerability

For reporting security issues, please get in touch with the maintainers instead of creating a public issue about it.
The maintainers should confirm that they've received the report within a couple of days.

If you can't find a better way to establish contact, you can check <https://www.ljoonal.xyz/contact>.
