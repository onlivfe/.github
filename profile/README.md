# Onlivfe

Onlivfe provides a way to keep track of identities across social VR platforms, or the so called "the metaverse".

It's currently [on the way towards MVP](https://github.com/orgs/onlivfe/projects/1). It's already public to gauge general interest & help with collaborating on finding the right design decisions.

It's also the homeplace for some related client libraries, which other projects are welcome to use as well.
