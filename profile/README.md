# Onlivfe

Onlivfe provides a way to keep track of identities across social VR platformsm, or the so called "the metaverse".

It's currently not even yet at an MVP implementation, but this has been setup to gauge general interest & help with finding the right design decisions.

It's also the homeplace for some related client libraries, which other projects are welcome to use as well.
